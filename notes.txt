If a logged in session logs out then 
This behavior indicates that when you clear cookies, cache, and local storage for a specific domain, it affects all tabs sharing the same session 
data for that domain. Essentially, Chrome doesn't treat tabs independently when it comes to cookies and storageâ€”they're global to the browser.

To fix this and allow multiple independent sessions for the same domain, you need to implement session isolation. Unfortunately, Chrome Extensions 
don't directly support true session isolation, but there are a couple of workarounds:

Why the YouTube doesn't work 

YouTube might store login tokens in IndexedDB or session storage, which are untouched by cookies removal.

SessionBox solution was :

SessionBox uses isolated browser profiles for tabs, effectively sandboxing each session. Each "box" operates in a virtualized environment, 
separating cookies, cache, storage, and authentication data from other tabs.

Solution for Youtube;

Delete All Cookies for Relevant Domains
Force Cache Clearing
Inject Scripts to Further Clear Persistent Data
